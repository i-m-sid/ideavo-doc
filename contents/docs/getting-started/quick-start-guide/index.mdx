4. You'll be redirected to your project page when complete

## Step 5: Explore Your Results

### If You Chose Validation Mode

You'll land on a comprehensive validation dashboard with 5 main sections:

1. **Overview**: Overall validation score and summary
2. **Validation Scores**: Detailed breakdown of metrics

5. **Live Preview**: See your application in real-time

## Step 6: Iterate and Improve

### From Validation Mode
- Review the analysis and insights
- Click **Start Building** to switch to Build Mode
- Use the validation insights to guide your development

### From Build Mode

  - "Create a responsive navbar"
  - "Add a database to store user data"

## Step 7: Deploy Your App (Build Mode Only)

1. When you're ready to deploy, look for deployment options in the interface
2. Choose your preferred platform:
   - **Vercel**: Great for frontend applications
