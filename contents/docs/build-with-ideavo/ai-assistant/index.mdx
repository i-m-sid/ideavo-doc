# AI Assistant

## Two Modes

### Plan Mode
- Analyzes your requirements and creates a development plan
- Breaks down complex features into manageable tasks
- Provides project structure and technical recommendations
- Does not execute code or make changes

### Agent Mode
- Actively builds your application
- Writes code, creates files, and implements features
- Executes commands and manages the development environment
- Provides real-time progress updates

## Conversation Features

### Rewind to Previous Message
You can rewind the conversation to any previous message:

1. Click on any message in the chat history
2. Select "Rewind to here" from the context menu
3. The conversation will reset to that point
4. Continue development from that state

This feature is useful when:
- You want to explore different implementation approaches
- The AI made a mistake and you want to start from a previous working state
- You need to change direction in your project

### Context Awareness
The AI assistant maintains context throughout your conversation:
- Remembers your project requirements and preferences
- Tracks changes made to your codebase
- Understands the current state of your application
- Provides consistent responses based on your project history

## Best Practices

### Communicating with the AI
- Be specific about what you want to build or change
- Ask for explanations when you don't understand something
- Request code reviews and optimization suggestions
- Use the rewind feature to explore alternatives

### Getting Better Results
- Start with Plan mode for complex features
- Switch to Agent mode when ready to implement
- Provide feedback on generated code
- Ask for tests and documentation when needed
