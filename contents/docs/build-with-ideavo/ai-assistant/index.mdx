# AI Assistant

## Agent Mode
- Builds features autonomously across multiple files
- Writes code, creates files, and manages project structure
- Executes terminal commands and updates dependencies
- Tracks progress with real-time status updates
- Plans multi-step tasks and adapts to codebase context

## Context Awareness
The AI assistant maintains context throughout your conversation:
- Remembers your project requirements and preferences
- Tracks changes made to your codebase
- Understands the current state of your application
- Provides consistent responses based on your project history

## Best Practices

### Communicating with the AI
- Be specific about what you want to build or change or just discuss/plan
- Ask for explanations when you don't understand something
- Request code reviews and optimization suggestions
- Use the rewind feature to explore alternatives
